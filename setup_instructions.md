## Folder Structure
Create the following folder structure:

```
cv_generator/
├── main.py                 # Main Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies

```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash

### 2. Create Utils Package
Create an empty `__init__.py` file in the `utils` folder to make it a Python package:

```bash
touch utils/__init__.py
```

### 3. Dropbox Setup
1. Go to [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Click "Create app"
3. Choose "Scoped access"
4. Choose "Full Dropbox" or "App folder" based on your needs
5. Give your app a name
6. Generate an access token from the app settings
7. Copy the access token (you'll need this in the app)

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure all dependencies are installed
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Dropbox Upload Fails**:
   - Check your access token
   - Ensure the folder path exists or has proper permissions
   - Test the connection using the sidebar button

3. **PDF Generation Fails**:
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Check that the temp directory has write permissions

4. **Module Not Found Errors**:
   - Ensure the `utils/__init__.py` file exists
   - Run the app from the correct directory

### File Permissions
Make sure the application has:
- Read/write permissions in the application directory
- Permission to create the `temp/` folder
- Network access for Dropbox uploads

## Customization Options

### CV Template
You can modify the CV template in `utils/cv_generator.py`:
- Change colors, fonts, and styling
- Add new sections (skills, certifications, etc.)
- Modify the layout and formatting

### Data Collection
Extend `utils/data_collection.py` to collect additional information:

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Tokens**: Never commit Dropbox access tokens to version control
2. **Temporary Files**: The app automatically cleans up temporary files
3. **Password Format**: Default uses DDMMYYYY format - consider if this meets your security requirements
4. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file system permissions are set

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Ensure proper folder structure and permissions
4. Test Dropbox connection separately if upload issues occur
